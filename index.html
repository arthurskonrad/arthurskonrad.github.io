          I'm a frontend engineer with over seven years of experience crafting
          web interfaces utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My expertise lies
          in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and jQuery. I take pride in my
          collaborative approach and communication skills, honed through
          extensive teamwork and pair programming.

        <h2>My Strongest Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication, Collaboration, and Understanding:</strong> My
            experience working within diverse teams has strengthened these
            essential qualities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>React and JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript was my
            foundational language, and I transitioned smoothly into React
            development, continuously improving my skills through self-study and
            collaboration with colleagues.

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I'm an avid painter. Weekends often find me at my
          local coffee shop, enjoying the creative process with my tablet. While
          I don't consider myself a professional, painting is a fulfilling
          hobby.
